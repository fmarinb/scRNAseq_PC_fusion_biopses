# scRNAseq _PC_fusion_biopses
 This repository stores the R scripts corresponding to the secondary scRNAseq analyses on data already pre-processed by Genyo's Genomics and Bioinformatics Unit. The scripts contain the steps used for: 1- Cancer-oriented cell annotation by scATOMIC. 2- Differential expression analysis between clusters of cells. 3- Functional enrichment analysis by ssGSEA. 4- Differential abundance analysis to identify cells associated with high tumourgenicity. 5- Training of machine learning models for the classification of genes of interest in pseudobulk format based on the tumourgenicity of the samples. 6- Study of the importance of genes in the best performing model (SHAP values) and exploratory analysis of gene expression.
